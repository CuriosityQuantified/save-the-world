# Project Overview

This project is an Interactive Simulation system that generates personalized scenario-based simulations using AI. The system:

- Creates scenarios using LLMs for content generation
- Produces videos through RunwayML API
- Generates narration audio via ElevenLabs API
- Presents these to users who respond with their choices
- Creates branching narratives based on user input

Key resources:
- [build-plan.md](mdc:build-plan.md): Detailed phased development approach
- [flow.md](mdc:flow.md): Core simulation flow and LLM orchestration
